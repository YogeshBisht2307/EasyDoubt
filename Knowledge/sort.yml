conversations:
  - - sorting algorithm
    - A sorting algorithm is used to rearrange array or a list element according to a comparision operator.
  - - quick sort
    - quick sort is commonly used to sort an data structure by using divide and conquer method.
  - - selection sort
    - Selection sort has a less time complexity 0(n) as compared to insertion sort which is 0(n^2).
  - - bubble sort
    - Bubble sort algorithm checks the condition for each element for its each successor and perform swapping operation.
  - - insertion sort
    - Insertion sort searches for the lowest element in the data structure and put it on its right location.
  - - heap sort
    - heap sort algorithm uses the heap table and the concept of binary search tree for sorting in data structure.
  - - radix sort
    - In radix sort a list of integer number sorted on the basis of digit of individual numbers.
  - - shell sort
    - Shell sort is an algorithm that sort the element far from each other and successively reduce the interval between the element which is to be sorted.
  - - counting sort
    - counting sort is a sorting technique based on keys between a specific range.
  - - time complexity
    - Time complexity is a measurement of time taken by a process to execute.
